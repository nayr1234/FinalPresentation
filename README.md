  <p> GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. </p>'mecisamente


<p>When multiple developers commit code with git, GitHub becomes a central repository where all the code that everyone's working on can stay in sync. You'll commit your changes, and other developers will pull them (i.e. sync them to their local repository). You'll do the same with their code. </p> 'macarandan'
